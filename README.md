StripeDemo
==========

Simple iOS and Rails application to demonstrate the capabilities of Stripe. This app was demonstrated as part of a talk given at iOS KW on May 14th, 2013.

PLEASE NOTE: You will need to update the Stripe API keys on both the iOS app and the server in order to get this example functioning. You can find these keys in your account settings on the Stripe dashboard.
